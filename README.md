# 🗺 Map App 🗺

### To Demo

Current MVP version doesn't have form validation, so some addresses I've validated are working are: 

- 3500 Market Street Philadelphia PA
- 4000 Larchwood Ave
- 990 Spring Garden St

but if you have another Philly address in mind, give it a shot! 

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Component scaffold

This project used Generate React CLI to speed up development and scaffold components and tests:

npx generate-react-cli component MyComponent
